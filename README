This script helps researchers authenticate with a Fitbit account and retrieve sleep data. The data is saved as a CSV file with a date-stamped filename for easy organization.

Prerequisites
Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js installed (version 18 or higher is recommended).
Environment Variables: You need to set up environment variables for authentication.
Fitbit Developer Account: Obtain a Fitbit OAuth2 client ID and secret.

Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fitbit-data-retrieval.git
cd fitbit-data-retrieval

Install Dependencies:

Install the required Node.js packages by running:

npm install

Configure Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the following lines, replacing the placeholders with your actual values:
CLIENT_ID=your_fitbit_client_id
CLIENT_SECRET=your_fitbit_client_secret
REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/callback

HOW TO USE THE SCRIPT

1. Open the terminal 
  The server will run on port 3001 by default.
  Start the server with:
  node index.js
  The terminal should say: "Server running on http://localhost:${port}" port defaults to 3001, but could be another if changed

2. Next we have to login to our account and authorize which fitbit account we will get data from
  Open your web browser and navigate to:
  http://localhost:3001/auth
  This will redirect you to Fitbit's authorization page. Log in with your Fitbit account and authorize the application.

3. Handle the Callback:
After authorization, Fitbit will redirect you to:
http://localhost:3000/callback
The script will exchange the authorization code for an access token and store it.
YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DO ANYTHING HERE
The screen should (hopefully) say: "Authorization successful! You can now retrieve sleep data."

4. Retrieve Sleep Data
To fetch and download sleep data, if the authentication was succesful, go to:
http://localhost:3001/get-sleep-data
This will generate a CSV file with sleep data and prompt a download.
